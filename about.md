I'm a software engineer with experience in systems programming, full-stack web development, and embedded systems.

Right now I'm working at Meta. Previously I worked at Google on [Project Starline](https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline).

Feel free to reach me at [{{ site.author.email }}](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) if you'd like to chat.
